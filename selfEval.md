# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    Pretty solid on these.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
   Not as solid, but still pretty good at the moment.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
   If statements are solid, but weaving them with interpolation isn't.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
   3 hours, and longer, but I didn't intend to do all challenges when I started. 
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
   Interpolation and I don't need to adjust my calendar, I just need to dedicate time.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
   I'm gonna ask them tommorrow during Study Hall.
