// In the below exercises, write code that achieves the desired result. 
// To check your work, run this file by entering the following command in your Terminal: `node ifStatements.js`

// CHALLENGE 1
// Using the numQuarters variable defined below, determine if you have enough money to buy a gumball. A gumball costs two quarters.
var gumballCost = 2;
console.log(numQuarters >= gumballCost);
// Right now, the program will print out both "I have enough money for a gumball" and "I don't have enough money for a gumball". 
// Write a conditional statement that prints only one or the other.
// Experiment with manipulating the value held within numQuarters to make sure both conditions can be achieved.

var numQuarters = 0;

var numQuarters = 6;
function gumballBuy() {
  if (numQuarters <= 1) {
    return "I don't have enough money for a gumball.";
  }
  if (numQuarters >= 2) {
   return "I have enough money for a gumball.";
  }
}
console.log(gumballBuy());

Revised:
function gumballBuy() {
  if (numQuarters >= 2) {
    return "I have enough money for a gumball.";
  }
  else {
    return "I don't have neough money for a gumball.";
  }
}
// CHALLENGE 2
// Using the variables defined below, write code that will tell you if you have the ingredients to make a pizza. 
// A pizza requires at least two cups of flour and sauce.

// You should be able to change the variables to achieve the following outputs:
// If cupsOfFlour = 1 and hasSauce = true, print "I cannot make pizza"
// If cupsOfFlour = 5 and hasSauce = false, print "I cannot make pizza"
// If cupsOfFlour = 2 and hasSauce = true, print "I can make pizza"
// If cupsOfFlour = 3 and hasSauce = true, print "I can make pizza"


//Re-read it, and now understand what I missed the first time. 

var cupsOfFlour = 3;
var hasSauce = true;
function makePizza() {
  if(cupsOfFlour === 2 || cupsOfFlour === 3 && hasSauce === true) {
    return "I can make  pizza.";
  }
   else if(cupsOfFlour === 1 || cupsOfFlour === 5 && hasSauce === false) {
    return "I cannot make pizzza.";
  }
}
console.log(makePizza());

Revised:
function makePizza() {
  if (cupsOfFlour >= 2 && hasSauce === true) {
    return "I can make pizza.";
  }
  else {
    return "I cannot make pizza.";
  }
}

// Experiment with manipulating the value held within both variables to make sure all above conditions output what you expect.

var cupsOfFlour = 1;
var hasSauce = true;
